 * connection with {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#connect connect }
 * and call {@link #getOutputStream getOutputStream() } to retrieve the discard
 * output stream. Don't close the output stream when you're done writing to it.
 * Rather, call {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#disconnect disconnect
 * } to clean up properly.
